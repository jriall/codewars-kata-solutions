// Ermahgerd girl wants you to write a function that translates english into ermahgerd language!! There are many different subtleties to the translation but for this Kata we'll focus on just a few core ones:

// For this specific translation it's probably best to implement these features in the order below:

// Ermahgerd girl is ALWAYS very excited so everything needs to be in UPPERCASE!
// Each vowel should be replaced with: 'ER'
// Double "ER"s --->'ERER' and the letters 'ERH' should be replaced with just 'ER'
// The letters 'MY' (as a word or part of a word) should be replaced with: 'MAH'
// And to help with readability:

// Duplicate 'RR's should become a single 'R'
// After these steps are complete words longer than 4 letters that end in "ER" should have the "ER" trimmed off (the tricky bit is to make sure it can handle commas or spaces)

// SOLUTION

function ermahgerd(text) {
  return text.toUpperCase().replace(/[AEIOU]/g, "ER").replace(/ERER|ERH/g, "ER").replace(/MY/g, "MAH").replace(/RR/g, "R").replace(/\b[A-Z]{3,}ER\b/g, match=>match.substr(0, match.length-2));
}
