// In this Kata, you will be given an array of integers whose elements have both a negative and a positive value, except for one integer that is either only negative or only positive. Your task will be to find that integer.

// For example,

// solve[1,-1,2,-2,3] = 3  --> 3 only has a positive ocurrence.
// solve([-3,1,2,3,-1,-4,-2]) = -4  --> -4 only has a negative occurence
// solve([1,-1,2,-2,3,3]) = 3  --> the integer that is only positive or only negative my appear more than once.

// SOLUTION

function solve(arr){
  return arr.filter(a=>arr.indexOf(-a)===-1)[0];
}
